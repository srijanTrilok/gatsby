This template builds a simple application using Gatsby.  Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps.  The website is statically generated by a Node.js application during the build step, and then served statically at runtime.

## Features

* Node.js 14
* Automatic TLS certificates
* yarn-based build

## Customizations

This template customizes the [Gatsby starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) boilerplate project, but the changes will be very similar for most Gatsby projects. If using this project as a reference for your own existing project, replicate the changes below to your project.

* The `.platform.app.yaml`, `.platform/services.yaml`, and `.platform/routes.yaml` files have been added.  These provide Platform.sh-specific configuration and are present in all projects on Platform.sh.  You may customize them as you see fit.
* An additional module, [`config-reader-nodejs`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-nodejs), has been added.  It provides convenience wrappers for accessing the Platform.sh environment variables.
